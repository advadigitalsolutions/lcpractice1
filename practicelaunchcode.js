/*
Writing meaningful variable names helped me keep track of what I was doing as I made changes and thought out the operations.
Common pitfalls to avoid when naming variables include using vague names, using names that are too long, and using names that are too similar to other variables.
Clear variable names benefit team collaboration by making it easier for other team members to understand what the
code is doing and what the variables are for.
